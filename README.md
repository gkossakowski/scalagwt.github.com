Site and Blog Source
====================

This is generated using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to
produce a static website including blog content.

HOWTO (for contributors)
------------------------

Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:scalagwt/scalagwt.github.com.git

Then go to work on the appropriate files.

While you are working, if you would like to preview locally, install
and run jekyll.  Something like this:

    gem install jekyll
    jekyll --server --auto

will allow you to open the preview of the site on
`http://localhost:4000`  You may have to install some dependencies, like
[pygments](http://pygments.org/), if you don't already have them.

When your changes are ready, just commit them and push back up to
github:

    git commit
    git push

That's it!  GitHub runs Jekyll as part of their GitHub Pages service,
and will generate the static version of the site and mount it at the
appropriate URL(s).
